This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/(pages)/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Configuration

The middleware fetches redirect rules from `/api/v1/admin/redirections`. If this request takes too long it can lead to a timeout. You can control how long the middleware waits by setting `REDIRECTS_FETCH_TIMEOUT` (milliseconds) in your environment. It defaults to `3000`. The cache duration of these rules can be configured with `REDIRECTS_CACHE_DURATION`.
